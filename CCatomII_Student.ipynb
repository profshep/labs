    "Two fundamentally different approaches can be used to account for correlation effects: Moller Plesset perturbation theory or Coupled Cluster theory. It can be shown that in the limit of a complete basis set, the energy resulting from the exact many-electron Schrodinger equation is equivalent to the energy resulting from a linear combination of the ground electronic state configuration and all possible excited state electronic configurations. Practically speaking, the number of excited states is typically restricted to a specific number of excitations. For Couple Cluster theory, 'ccsd' calculations account for states corresponding to single and double excitations while 'ccsd(t)' also accounts for some triple excitations. Moller Plesset perturbation theory assumes the zeroth-order Hamiltonian is the Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian. For this method the Hartree-Fock energy is the sum of the zeroth and first order corrections, thus the correlation energy is the sum of all the pertubation-energy corrections from the second order 'mp2' and higher, e.g., 'mp4'.
